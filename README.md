# Modified-PageRank

This repository contains the a modified version of the PageRank algorithm for temporal graphs. The algorithm and code for this is present in the folder PageRank code.
The code for generating the RMat graphs is in the folder RMat generator.
The folder Datasets contains the 9 graph datasets that we experimented on. The temporal pagerank values for these graphs are in the folder Temporal PageRank values. (For calulating the temporal pagerank values : https://github.com/ferencberes/online-centrality )
The code for calculating the temporal betweenness centrality values is in the folder Temporal Betweenness Centrality (Refer https://teneto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/teneto.networkmeasures.temporal_betweenness_centrality.html). This folder also contains the centrality values for the graphs present in Datasets.
